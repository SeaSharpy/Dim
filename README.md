# Fun programming language

- we got oop
- we got gc
- we got tiny standard library
- we got tiny runtime

basically the source files are transpiled to C and the C calls garbage collection every so often and manages classes and refcounting

please try and read my spaghetti code and help me with this project because I'm kinda cooked with how awful the code is

I really want to continue with this but I can't

I think this should work in linux but only tested in windows
